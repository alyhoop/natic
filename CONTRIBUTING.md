# Contributing

Guidelines to communicate how people should contribute to [Natic](https://github.com/NaticOrg/natic/). This
 defines the workflow for branching, pull requests and format for creating an issue.

 When contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish to make via issue, email, or any other method with the owners of this repository before making a change.

## Workflow

We use GitHub Flow for the development workflow.

1. A developer **forks** an [official](https://github.com/NaticOrg/natic) server-side repository. This creates their own server-side copy.
2. The new server-side copy is cloned to their local system.
3. A Git remote path for the [official](https://github.com/NaticOrg/natic) repository is added to the local clone.
4. A new local feature branch is created.
5. The developer makes changes on the new branch.
6. New commits are created for the changes.
7. The branch gets pushed to the developer's own server-side copy.
8. The developer opens a pull request from the new branch to the [official](https://github.com/NaticOrg/natic) repository.
9. The pull request gets approved for merge and is merged into the [official](https://github.com/NaticOrg/natic) repository

## Branching

Contributors will create a branch, then submit a pull request that must then be
 approved by 2 reviewers for it to be merged into master.

## Pull Requests

1. Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface, this includes new environment variables, exposed ports, useful file locations and container parameters.
2. Two approving reviews are required when attempting to merge into master.
